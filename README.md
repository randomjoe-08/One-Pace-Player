# One Pace Player

A custom web player built for watching [One Pace](https://onepace.net/) without relying on PixelDrain’s viewer. This project offers a clean layout, smooth controls, and a polished interface. Everything is packaged inside a single HTML file that contains all CSS and JavaScript, which makes it simple to use and easy to download.

## Why this player exists

PixelDrain places limits on how its video API and embed features can be used. Hosting a public website that loads videos directly from PixelDrain can trigger restrictions, rate limits, or cross domain blocks. To overcome this, the player is designed as a local HTML file you open directly in your browser. This avoids any server use and keeps everything inside your own device.

## Features

- Clean modern UI  
- Single standalone HTML file  
- Easily switch from different resolutions and tracks
- Smooth animations  
- Keyboard controls  
- Perfect for One Pace viewing

## How it works

1. Open the file in any browser.  
2. The player loads the stream directly inside your browser.  
3.  Bookmark the file for ease of use.

No external hosting or backend is used.

## Installation

All you need to do is download the player HTML file from the Release tab, then open the file in your web browser of choice. There is nothing to install and no setup required.
